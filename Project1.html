                 <h2><strong>Step 1</strong></h2>
                    <p><strong>Downloading software:</strong></p>
                    <p>First thing to do was to download the relevant software for making and hosting a website on Github. I started off by downloading <a href="http://brackets.io/">"Brackets"</a> from their website, as instructed in the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGuNTpc293hpIpAVSJ3-SgNolCTa1BfJE">video</a> given to us by the teacher:  </p>

                <header>
                </header>
                <header>
                <p>Next thing to download before starting was <a href="https://git-scm.com/">"Git"</a>, by clicking "download for windows" on their website and then finding the correct version for my setup, which for my case ended up to be the 64-bit one.
                </header>
                <header>
                <p>Then the last thing to download was a free template for my website from:<a href="https://html5up.net/">https://html5up.net/</a> . I ended up choosing the <a href="https://html5up.net/miniport">"Miniport template"</a> as I thought it was the one most like other portfolio examples found from google.

                 <h2><strong>Step 2</strong></h2>
                    <p><strong>Editing template:</strong></p>
                    <p>To edit the template I first had to import the Index file from it to the Brackets workspace. I did that simply by dragging it as seen on the image: </p>

                    <a class="image-fit"><img src="images/Index_to_brackets.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                <header>
                </header>
                <header>
<p>and the first and easiest changes i made to the template was to replace all name and most text to a more relevant one, for example my name instead of "John doe". I then found images for my project by screenshotting various parts of the working process, or taking them from google. Switching from template images to mine was simply a matter of putting them in the "images" folder and changing the "src=" text in the html. to the name of the relevant images.

                <header>
                </header>
                <header>
 <p>The last thing to do was to add html files that correspond to the different pages i want present on my website. In my case i needed: Project1, About me, and the Pdf file for my Resume, (Project 2-final will come later) by simply copy-pasting the index.hmtl and adding a link to them from my home page.

                 <h2><strong>Step 3</strong></h2>
                    <p><strong>Uploading website to Github:</strong></p>
                    <p>When uploading a I followed the step by step guide by the teacher. I started by loging in to my already existing account and clicking on "Create a new repository". Then i opened up Git bash software downladed in Step 1 and wrote the following: </p>
                </header>                
                    <a class="image"><img src="images/Github.png" alt="" /></a>
                <header>
                </header>
                <header>
Heres what its looks like to write the final code in:

                    <header>
                        and now the website is online!
