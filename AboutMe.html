                 <h2><strong>About me</strong></h2>
                    <p>My name is Andri Freyr Eyjólfsson. I was born and raised in Kópavogur, Iceland, and im currently studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Iceland. The reason for this choice of study is that i've always felt that real world broblems can be solved by thinking both rationally and creatively, just like an engineer.

                <h2><strong>My interests</strong></h2>
                 <p>I have many interests when it comes to my personal and social life. My favourate thing to do, and what i spend most of my time doing, is hanging around friends and familiy. Most of the time we play board games, video games, or just plain talking. A recent hobby of mine has been listening to audiobooks when driving or doing other mundane tasks, and highly recommend: "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind", which is a favourite of mine.

                <h2><strong>What i hope to get from this class</strong></h2>
                 <p>My hope from this class is to introduce myself to new possibilities that computers can offer in the workplace. I would like to know more about their role in automating certain work aspects that previously we done exclusively by human hands.

                <h2><strong>My idea for a final project</strong></h2>
                 <p>As this class is just about beginning, I am not sure what options i have for a final project. But if i had to throw one out there, I would like to make some sort of a family friendly boardgame, that can be played with a big group.
